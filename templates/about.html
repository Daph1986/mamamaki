          My name is Daphne Heimgartner and I’m a Japan fan.<br>
          The first time I visited Japan was in 2013, after that time I went for
          3 more times.
          I love everything about it, the land, the people, the culture
          and mostly the food.

          Japanese food is so much more than sushi and noodles. 
          Moreover, the Japanese cuisine is also very healthy.
          People take their time for the food, there are heaps of eateries in Japan. 
          You will not see the people there walking through the city and eating in the meantime, 
          not even on the local train or metro. 
          An exception to this are the Shinkansen trains. 
          For this it is customary to buy a 'bento' box for on the road, at the station 
          for example. Most major stations I've been to, are a dream come true for a food lover. 
          There are sometimes entire streets underground with eateries and shops. 
          So you never have to look far for something delicious.

          I am also a big fan of Japanese fast food restaurants.
          Examples of this are the chains 'Yoshinoya' and 'Matsuya', 
          the meals there are relatively healthy and certainly not expensive.
          Here you can enjoy 'gyudon' and a 'curry bowl' among other things.
          Another good place to eat is an 'Izakaya' or traditional Japanese bar. 
          In most you can get yakitori, seafood, sushi, sashimi and fried chicken among other things.

          Back to this page, conclusion I really love the Japanese food and
          near where I live is an Asian wholesaler. I found a simple Japanese
          cookbook and then I just started to try the recipes out.
          My husband loved it and gave me another cookbook for my
          birthday. 
          Since it’s easy to cook these recipes at home I want to share them
          with you.
        </p>

          When I recently spoke to my husband about this site, 
          and our 2-year-old son heard the word 'sushi', 
          he said in Dutch: 
          “Mama make sushi, mama maki” so that's how the name MAMAMAKI was found.
        </p>

          at home, please be so kind and share them here.
