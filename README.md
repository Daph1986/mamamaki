UX
======

This is meant to be a B2C site which targets visitors who are interested in Japanese home cooking.

### User stories

##### Visitor Goals

- To be able to see different recipes and search for them using keywords.
- To create an account and log in on that account.
- To create, read, update and delete my own recipes.

##### Site Owners Goals

- To share the love for Japanese home cooking and promote it.
- Share nice Japanese home cooking recipes.

### Strategy

The design goal is to make a clear, accessible, structured site so that visitors can easily see the recipes, navigate on the site and add, edit and delete their own recipes.

### Scope

The site shows a homepage with a small introduction. Second is the about page which tells a bit about the creator of the site and why the site was created. Furthermore, the site contains a recipes page on which you can you choose to go to a specific recipe. It also contains a register page, a log in page, a personal recipe page and a add recipe page.
The personal recipe page and add recipe page will only be visible when you are logged in.

### Structure

The site will be structured as clear as possible, it should be easy to see what you can do on the page, on all screen sizes it should be clear what you can do on each part of the site. 

### Skeleton

Desktop wireframes <br>
<img src="static/readme images/desktop_all_pages.png" alt="Desktop overview" width="85%" height="85%">

Tablet wireframes <br>

Mobile wireframes<br>

Raw data diagram<br>

<img src="static/readme images/raw_data_diagram.png" alt="Data Overview" width="65%" height="65%"><br>
Eventually some items were added to the diagram and it has been simplified.
<img src="static/readme images/updated_data_diagram.png" alt="Data Overview" width="65%" height="65%">

**Surface**

The following colors will be used:

<img src="static/readme images/hex_DF5B5B.png" alt="Side menu color" width="25%" height="25%"> <img src="static/readme images/hex_FFFFFF.png" alt="Side menu text color" width="25%" height="25%"> <img src="static/readme images/hex_212121.png" alt="Text color"  width="25%" height="25%"> <br>

And for a gradient background: <br>
<img src="static/readme images/hex_DE5959.png" alt="Gradient 1"  width="25%" height="25%"> <img src="static/readme images/hex_EFAA9C.png" alt="Gradient 2"  width="25%" height="25%"> <img src="static/readme images/hex_F3BEA2.png" alt="Gradient 3"  width="25%" height="25%"><img src="static/readme images/hex_F1DEC2.png" alt="Gradient 4"  width="25%" height="25%"> <br>

Which results in this: <br>
<img src="static/readme images/gradient_backrgound.png" alt="Gradient background colors" width="25%" height="25%"> <br>
For this [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/gradient3?ori=to+right+top&hex=%23FEFFFA&hex2=%23E9E1C7&hex3=%23A0C7D7&submit=submit) was used.

The colors were chosen because they fit very well with Japan, reminding of Sakura blossoms. The background of the sea is a reference to a traditional Japanese painting, called ‚ÄúThe Great Wave off Kanagawa‚Äù. <br>
<img src="static/readme images/background_login.png" alt="Waves background" width="45%" height="45%"> <br>

This was chosen because it gives a nice separation to the register and log in page from the rest of the site and I think it connects well with the recipes, because a few of them use fish as an ingredient. And fish comes from the sea.

The first set up for the wireframes was with a grey background and footer, but it was felt to be UX unappealing, that‚Äôs why this was changed to the current wireframes.

During development the site's layout was restructured a little bit, because this seemed visually or otherwise better.
What was changed is:

1. <br>
On the register page the headers were outside the white block, but this gave a problem with the flash messages. They pushed the content down, the headers text becaume hard. <br>
<img src="static/readme images/headers_with_flash_message_1.png" alt="Headers with Flash message before" width="45%" height="45%"> <br>

So it was decided to put the headers in the white register block to solve this. And in the end it was decided to put the flash message in a white bar with blue text, to put it more downwards and to give it a fade out. This is better for the end user because the text disappears without the page having to be reloaded.<br>

<img src="static/readme images/headers_with_flash_message_2.png" alt="Headers with Flash message after" width="45%" height="45%"> <br>

2. <br>
Originally the texts were aligned left, but in the actual design this didn't look right. Also for the footer it looked better when everything was centered.<br>
<img src="static/readme images/text_align_left.png" alt="Text align left" width="45%" height="45%"> <br>
So centering the text seemed better.<br>
<img src="static/readme images/text_align_center.png" alt="Text align center" width="45%" height="45%"> <br>

3. <br>
Two call to action buttons have been added to the homepage to make it more user-friendly and to register or log in right away. A contact form has also been added, again to increase user-friendliness.

4. <br>
Scroll to the top buttons have been added on all pages, because you don't have to scroll all the way up again, this improves user-friendliness. They will appear automatically as soon as you have to scroll down.

5. <br>
On the about page the words "register page" have been linked to go directly to that page.

6. <br>
On the single recipe page, the ingredients list and the instruction list have been made collapsible to make it easier during cooking, when you have the ingredients ready, just close it and keep only the instruction list open. Because not all the recipes show the calories, it has been decided to omit that and instead put down which user has added the recipe.

7. <br>
Some additional text has been added to the personal recipe page to indicate what it displays.

8. <br>
Some extra fields have been added to the add recipe page, namely "remarks", "additional notes" and a switch for if it's a vegetarian recipe.

### Fonts and icons

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to embed the Chicle and Ubuntu font in the code. Chicle was chosen because this reminds of Japanse calligraphy. Ubuntu was chosen because for the main text I felt this has a better readability which gives better UX.

For the icons [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used.

<img src="static/readme images/deployment_link_1.png" alt="Deployment link 1" width="75%" height="50%"/>
<img src="static/readme images/deployment_link_2.png" alt="Deployment link 2" width="75%" height="50%"/>

### Run local

If you would like to run this website locally you can clone this repository in an IDE such as VSCode. Make sure that `PIP`, `Flask`, `Python3` and `Git` are installed. Set up your account for [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), how to do that you can see [here](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/).
You can clone it by following the next steps: <br>

1. Log in at [GitHub](https://github.com/) 
2. Find Daph1986's [page](https://github.com/Daph1986)
3. Select repositories.
4. Select the mamamaki repository.
5. Click on the "Code" button. <br>
<img src="static/readme images/run_local_1.png" alt="Run local 1" width="75%" height="50%"/> <br>

6. Copy the URL.
7. Open VScode or your preferred IDE, open the file or folder in which you want to use the project and open a CLI terminal.
8. Put the following command in the CLI terminal:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/Daph1986/mamamaki.git
``` 

9. Press enter and the clone will be created.
10. Create a new `Cluster` and a new `Database` in your MongoDB account.
In this cases the database is called `mamamaki_recipe_manager`, two collections are used:<br>
<img src="static/readme images/db_1.png" alt="MongoDB 1" width="50%" height="50%"/> <br> 
and they are filled out like this:<br> 
<img src="static/readme images/db_2.png" alt="MongoDB 1" width="50%" height="50%"/> <br> 
<img src="static/readme images/db_3.png" alt="MongoDB 1" width="50%" height="50%"/>

11. Create an `env.py` file, type
```
touch env.py
```
in the CLI terminal, use this file for storing your variables. It should contain this:
```
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "value")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "value")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "value")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "value")
```
For `IP` you can use `0.0.0.0`, for `PORT` you can use `5000` for `SECRET_KEY` you can make up your own password or use [RandomKeygen](https://randomkeygen.com/) to generate a password. The `MONGO_URI` and `MONGO_DBNAME` values you can find in your MongoDB account.
Your `MONGO_DBNAME` is here:<br>
<img src="static/readme images/mongo_db_1.png" alt="MongoDB 1" width="75%" height="50%"/> <br>
The `MONGO_URI` you'll find when you click `Clusters` and then `Connect`.
<img src="static/readme images/mongo_db_2.png" alt="MongoDB 2" width="75%" height="50%"/> <br>
Choose the option in the middle<br>
<img src="static/readme images/mongo_db_3.png" alt="MongoDB 3" width="75%" height="50%"/> <br>
Set it to `Python` and version `3.6 or later`. Copy the code you see here:<br>
<img src="static/readme images/mongo_db_4.png" alt="MongoDB 4" width="75%" height="50%"/> <br>
Replace the password with your own and replace the database name for your own.

12. Create a `.gitignore` file type
```
touch .gitignore
```
in the CLI terminal, this file is to make sure that the variables of the `env.py` are not being published. It should contain:
```
env.py
__pycache__/

```
13. You can now run the app by tying:
```
python3 app.py
```
in the CLI terminal. It will show ` * Running on http://192.168.1.170:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)` in the terminal, you can visit the website by pressing the link holding the CTRL or COMMAND button, depending on if you are using a Windows or IOS system.

<div align="right"><a href="#top">üîù</a></div>

### Heroku

To create a live version of the website VSCode was used together with Heroku.
To deploy the website with Heroku the following steps were made:

1. Create a `requirement.txt` and `Procfile` file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` and then `echo web: python app.py >Procfile` in the CLI terminal.
2. Make sure that these files are commited, added and pushed to your GitHub repository.
3. Log in or create an account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and create a new app by clicking the button.<br>
<img src="static/readme images/heroku_deployment_1.png" alt="Deployment to Heroku 1" width="75%" height="50%"/>

4. Give the app a name in all lowercase letters and set `Choose a region` to Europe, click on create app.<br>
<img src="static/readme images/heroku_deployment_2.png" alt="Deployment to Heroku 2" width="75%" height="50%"/>

5. On you app dashboard click deploy and select GitHub, connect it to your GitHub respository. Don't click `Enable Automatic Deploys` yet. <br>
<img src="static/readme images/heroku_deployment_3.png" alt="Deployment to Heroku 3" width="75%" height="50%"/>

6. Click on Settings and then Reveal Config Vars. <br>
<img src="static/readme images/heroku_deployment_4.png" alt="Deployment to Heroku 4" width="75%" height="50%"/>

7. Fill in the vars with your own username, password, database name and secretkey which you have in your `env.py` file: <br>
| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| IP | 0.0.0.0 |
| MONGO_DBNAME | `<your_mongodb_database_name` |
| MONGO_URI | `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@myfirstcluster.z7l4s.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority` |
| PORT | 5000 |
| SECRET_KEY | `<your_secret_key>`|
<br>

8. Now click on `Enable Automatic Deploys` and then `Deploy Branch`
9. This can take a little bit, when it's ready you should see somthing like this:<br>
<img src="static/readme images/heroku_deployment_5.png" alt="Deployment to Heroku 5" width="75%" height="50%"/>
You can click the view button to launch your app.
