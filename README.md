:busts_in_silhouette: UX
======

This is meant to be a B2C site which targets visitors who are interested in Japanese home cooking.

### User stories

##### Visitor Goals

- To be able to see different recipes and search for them using keywords.
- To create an account and log in on that account.
- To create, read, update and delete my own recipes.

##### Site Owners Goals

- To share the love for Japanese home cooking and promote it.
- Share nice Japanese home cooking recipes.

### Strategy

The design goal is to make a clear, accessible, structured site so that visitors can easily see the recipes, navigate on the site and add, edit and delete their own recipes.

### Scope

The site shows a homepage with a small introduction. Second is the about page which tells a bit about the creator of the site and why the site was created. Furthermore, the site contains a recipes page on which you can you choose to go to a specific recipe. It also contains a register page, a log in page, a personal recipe page and a add recipe page.
The personal recipe page, add recipe page and the log out option will only be visible when you are logged in.
| Sidenav | Logged in User | Logged out User |
 --- | --- | ---
Home| &#9989; | &#9989; |
About |&#9989; | &#9989; |
Recipes|&#9989; | &#9989; |
Register| &#10060; | &#9989; |
Log in| &#10060; | &#9989; |
Personal recipe page| &#9989; | &#10060; |
Add recipe| &#9989; | &#10060; |
Log out| &#9989; | &#10060; |

Also on the homepage there is a difference in what you will see when you are logged in or logged out.

| Homepage | Logged in User | Logged out User |
 --- | --- | ---
Register button | &#10060; | &#9989; |
Log in button  | &#10060; | &#9989; |

A difference has also been made in user rights:
| Recipe options | Standard User Account | Admin User Account |
 --- | --- | ---
Add own recipe| &#9989; | &#9989; |
Edit own recipe | &#9989; | &#9989; |
Delete own recipe | &#9989; | &#9989; |
Edit recipes of other users| &#10060; | &#9989; |
Delete recipes of other users| &#10060; | &#9989; |

### Structure

The site will be structured as clear as possible, it should be easy to see what you can do on the page, on all screen sizes it should be clear what you can do on each part of the site. 

### Skeleton

The skeleton section is a bit more extensive, for that reason please view this separate [file](skeleton/README.md).
<div align="right"><a href="#top">üîù</a></div>

### Fonts and icons

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to embed the Chicle and Ubuntu font in the code. Chicle was chosen because this reminds of Japanese calligraphy. Ubuntu was chosen because for the main text I felt this has a better readability which gives better UX.

For the icons [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used.
