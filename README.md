MAMAMAKI is a site where it is possible to see Japanese home cooking recipes and where when loged in you can add and adjust your own recipes. 
The focus with this site is to combine knowledge about Japanese home cooking with what was learned this far about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. The siteâ€™s goal is to design share recipes.

UX
======

This is meant to be a B2B site which targets visitors  who are in need of business cards and want to design it themselves.

### User stories

##### Visitor Goals

<!-- - Create / design your own business card.
- Be able to choose the paper type and quantity.
- Request a sample kit with papers for if you are not familiar with the paper types.
- Request a quotation and download the designed card. -->

##### Site Owners Goals

<!-- - Provide the service of designing your own business cards in an easy way, without additional designing costs.
- Reduce workload on the prepress (design) staff.
- Expand customer base. -->

### Strategy

<!-- The design goal is to make a clear, accessible, structured site so that visitors can easily design their own business cards. -->

### Scope

<!-- The site shows a homepage with an explanation, there the user can either first request a sample kit for the paper types or start designing. On the creator site it allows the user to choose out of three different sizes of business cards, to choose a background color, to choose the paper type, to choose the quantity, to upload an own photo or logo, to edit text content, to download the designed card as a low-res jpeg file, to send a request for a quotation for the designed business cards. -->

### Structure

<!-- This site is structured as clear as possible, it is easy to see what can be done on the page, on all screen sizes it is clear what should be done on each part of the site. The design of the card is visible on all screen sizes. This all ensures that the user knows what to do and what to expect. -->

**Surface**

<!-- The colors that were used are the existing corporate identity colors, white and an off-white color, which are:

<img src="assets/images/readme_images/red.png" alt="Red" width="25%" height="25%"> <img src="assets/images/readme_images/red2.png" alt="Red 2" width="25%" height="25%"> <img src="assets/images/readme_images/dark_grey.png" alt="Dark Grey"  width="25%" height="25%"> <img src="assets/images/readme_images/white.png" alt="White"  width="25%" height="25%"> <img src="assets/images/readme_images/off_white.png" alt="Off White"  width="25%" height="25%">

The colors used as background colors for the user to select were found when another project was inspected with the DevTools. These colors have been chosen because they are full and bright. <br>
<img src="assets/images/readme_images/colors.png" alt="Background colors" width="25%" height="25%">

During development the site's layout was restructured a little bit, because this seemed visually or otherwise better.
What was changed is:

1. The color for the red headers and buttons were changed from #e73b3b to #e72f4c and #e02a51 because during testing #e73b3b did not give a good enough contrast.
2. The icon for the website was added, because it would be logical to refer to the main website of the company.
3. On the sample kit request form and the quotation request form a checkbox was added to reduce spam by checking if the user is a robot.
4. The layout for desktop view on the creator.html for the card selectors was changed a bit to make it look more appealing on smaller screens and to make it more logical to follow the steps.
5. The Select Size and Select Printing Method options were combined to give it a UX friendly experience.
6. The buttons for adding a text field, downloading the preview file and resetting the made choices are grouped together to present a better and UX friendly experience.
7. The button to upload an own file was separated from the other selectors and made pulsing to give it better attention.
8. The legend which explains all the lines (bleed etc.) of the templates has been put above the template to give it a UX friendly experience.
9. On the bottom of the page above the input fields for name and email address a small explanation was added to create a more UX friendly experience.
10. After testing the user-friendliness was experienced as not good enough, because only the logo could be used to return to the homepage. That is why on the page for requesting the sample kit and for designing the business card, 2 buttons have been added at the top to switch between the other pages. Cancel buttons have also been added to the bottom of the forms and the request quotation button was changed to send. This increases user-friendliness. -->

### Fonts and icons

<!-- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to embed the Roboto font in the code. Roboto was chosen because this is already in use on the existing POSTFLY site and it fits the corporate identity.

For the icons on the homepage [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used and for the other two pages the icons of [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/icons.html) were used. -->

#### Code:

<!-- 1. [Autoprefixer CSS](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to optimize the use of vendor extensions in the CSS code.
2. Adding the defer attribute to the script files in html was a tip given by my mentor Narender, this ensures that the script files are executed when the page has finished loading.
3. [Codegrepper](https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/javascript/getting+value+from+radio+button+javascript) for getting the value of the checked radio buttons instead of using for loops.
