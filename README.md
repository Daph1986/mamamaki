MAMAMAKI is a site for Japanese home cooking recipes and when you are loged in, you can add and edit your own recipes.
The focus with this site is to combine knowledge about Japanese home cooking with what was learned this far about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. The site‚Äôs goal is to share recipes.

UX
======

This is meant to be a B2C site which targets visitors who are interested in Japanese home cooking.

### User stories

##### Visitor Goals

- To be able to see different recipes and search for them.
- To create an account and log in on that account.
- To create, read, update and delete own recipes.

##### Site Owners Goals

- To share the love for Japanese home cooking and promote it.
- Share nice Japanese home cooking recipes.

### Strategy

The design goal is to make a clear, accessible, structured site so that visitors can easily see the recipes, navigate on the site and add + edit their own recipes.

### Scope

The site shows a home page with a small introduction. Second is the about page which tells a bit about the creator of the site and why the site was created. Furthermore, the site contains a recipe page on which you can you choose to go to a specific recipe. It also contains a register page, a log in page, a profile page and a add recipe page.
The profile page and add recipe page will only be visible when you are logged in.

### Structure

The site will be structured as clear as possible, it should be easy to see what you can do on the page, on all screen sizes it should be clear what you can do on each part of the site. 

### Skeleton

Desktop wireframes <br>
<img src="static/readme images/desktop_all_pages.png" alt="Desktop overview" width="85%" height="85%">

Tablet wireframes <br>

Mobile wireframes<br>

<img src="static/readme images/mobile_all_pages.png" alt="Mobile Overview" width="85%" height="85%">

Raw data diagram<br>

<img src="static/readme images/raw_data_diagram.png" alt="Data Overview" width="65%" height="65%">

**Surface**

The following colors will be used:

<img src="static/readme images/hex_DF5B5B.png" alt="Side menu color" width="25%" height="25%"> <img src="static/readme images/hex_FFFFFF.png" alt="Side menu text color" width="25%" height="25%"> <img src="static/readme images/hex_212121.png" alt="Text color"  width="25%" height="25%"> <br>

And for a gradient background: <br>
<img src="static/readme images/hex_DE5959.png" alt="Gradient 1"  width="25%" height="25%"> <img src="static/readme images/hex_EFAA9C.png" alt="Gradient 2"  width="25%" height="25%"> <img src="static/readme images/hex_F3BEA2.png" alt="Gradient 3"  width="25%" height="25%"><img src="static/readme images/hex_F1DEC2.png" alt="Gradient 4"  width="25%" height="25%"> <br>

Which results in this: <br>
<img src="static/readme images/gradient_backrgound.png" alt="Gradient background colors" width="25%" height="25%"> <br>
For this [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/gradient3?ori=to+right+top&hex=%23FEFFFA&hex2=%23E9E1C7&hex3=%23A0C7D7&submit=submit) was used.

The colors were chosen because they fit very well with Japan, reminding of Sakura blossoms. The background of the sea is a reference to a traditional Japanese painting, called ‚ÄúThe Great Wave off Kanagawa‚Äù. <br>
<img src="static/readme images/background_login.png" alt="Waves background" width="45%" height="45%"> <br>

This was chosen because it gives a nice separation to the register and log in page from the rest of the site and I think it connects well with the recipes, because a few of them use fish as an ingredient. And fish comes from the sea.

The first set up for the wireframes was with a grey background and footer, but it was felt to be UX unappealing, that‚Äôs why this was changed to the current wireframes.

During development the site's layout was restructured a little bit, because this seemed visually or otherwise better.
What was changed is:

1. <br>
On the register page the headers were outside the white block, but this gave a problem with the flash messages. They pushed the content down, the headers text becaume hard. <br>
<img src="static/readme images/headers_with_flash_message_1.png" alt="Headers with Flash message before" width="45%" height="45%"> <br>

So it was decided to put the headers in the white register block to solve this. <br>

<img src="static/readme images/headers_with_flash_message_2.png" alt="Headers with Flash message after" width="45%" height="45%"> <br>

2. <br>
Originally the texts were aligned left, but in the actual design this didn't look right.<br>
<img src="static/readme images/text_align_left.png" alt="Text align left" width="45%" height="45%"> <br>
So centering the text seemed better.<br>
<img src="static/readme images/text_align_center.png" alt="Text align center" width="45%" height="45%"> <br>

<!-- 1. The color for the red headers and buttons were changed from #e73b3b to #e72f4c and #e02a51 because during testing #e73b3b did not give a good enough contrast.
2. The icon for the website was added, because it would be logical to refer to the main website of the company.
3. On the sample kit request form and the quotation request form a checkbox was added to reduce spam by checking if the user is a robot.
4. The layout for desktop view on the creator.html for the card selectors was changed a bit to make it look more appealing on smaller screens and to make it more logical to follow the steps.
5. The Select Size and Select Printing Method options were combined to give it a UX friendly experience.
6. The buttons for adding a text field, downloading the preview file and resetting the made choices are grouped together to present a better and UX friendly experience.
7. The button to upload an own file was separated from the other selectors and made pulsing to give it better attention.
8. The legend which explains all the lines (bleed etc.) of the templates has been put above the template to give it a UX friendly experience.
9. On the bottom of the page above the input fields for name and email address a small explanation was added to create a more UX friendly experience.
10. After testing the user-friendliness was experienced as not good enough, because only the logo could be used to return to the homepage. That is why on the page for requesting the sample kit and for designing the business card, 2 buttons have been added at the top to switch between the other pages. Cancel buttons have also been added to the bottom of the forms and the request quotation button was changed to send. This increases user-friendliness. -->

### Fonts and icons

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to embed the Chicle and Ubuntu font in the code. Chicle was chosen because this reminds of Japanse calligraphy. Ubuntu was chosen because for the main text I felt this has a better readability which gives better UX.

For the icons [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used.

2. [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/nl/images/wave-tides-in-ukiyo-e-style/229859488) the wave image is a licensed image downloaded with a paid Adobe Stock account, the image was used for the background of the register and log in page.

3. Photos of the food, all these photos are my own.

4. [Color-hex](https://www.color-hex.com/) was used to get the images of the colors that were used.

5. [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/sushi/) was used to get an existing favicon for the site.

#### Code:

1. [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/gradient3?ori=to+right+top&hex=%23FEFFFA&hex2=%23E9E1C7&hex3=%23A0C7D7&submit=submit) to create the gradient background with CSS.
